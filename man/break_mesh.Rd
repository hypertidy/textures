\usage{
break_mesh(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{mesh3d, from e.g. \code{quad()}}
}

mesh3d
}
\description{
Break the topology of a mesh by expanding all vertices.
}
\details{
Details ... rgl is inherently \emph{topological}, but we can have primitives
that are geometrically independent. (One day I'll find a way to talk
about this that's not garble.)
}
\examples{
(mesh <- quad(depth = 3))
## same number of primitives, more vertices (every coordinate)
break_mesh(mesh)
}
