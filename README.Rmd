# textures

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of textures is to utilize texture mapping in rgl to work with images in different coordinate systems and mapped onto arbitrary shapes. 

There's a couple of functions in the package, with ongoing work to explore examples and align them 
to package functionality. 

The goal is for this package to illustrate texture mapping capability in rgl with *core techniques familiar to R users*, and with minimal *resort to specialist code*. When specialist code is required
it will be brought out explicitly and explained in a single-step. 


Very WIP

## Installation

Only for dev interest. 

```R
## install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hypertidy/textures")
```


## Example

A Mercator raster on a single quad. Zoom in and out but no translate or pivot (it's disabled). 

Maps an image onto a quad from a PNG file. 


```{r example, eval = FALSE}
## can't run this in rmarkdown as snapshot doesn't work
library(textures)
tfile <- tempfile()
png::writePNG(ga_topo$img/255, tfile)

quad0 <- quad(texfile = tfile)

quad0$vb[1L,] <- scales::rescale(quad0$vb[1,], to = ga_topo$extent[c("xmin", "xmax")])
quad0$vb[2L,] <- scales::rescale(quad0$vb[2L,], to = ga_topo$extent[c("ymin", "ymax")])


rgl::open3d()
rgl::plot3d(quad0, specular = "black")
set_scene()
dir.create("man/figures", showWarnings = FALSE)
rgl::rgl.bringtotop()
rgl::snapshot3d("man/figures/readme_ga000.png")


```

## Re-map projections

Create a generalized surface in arbitrary map projection and remap the image losslessly ...

TODO
