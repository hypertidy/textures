No code here yet, just ideas to flesh out. :)


The goal of textures is to utilize texture mapping in rgl to work with images in different coordinate systems and mapped onto arbitrary shapes. 

WIP


## Installation

Not yet. 


## Example

Not much yet, just a Mercator raster on a single quad. Zoom in and out but no translate (yet) or pivot (it's disabled). 
This is a basi
c example which shows you how to map an image onto a quad (4 coordinates) from a PNG file. 


```{r example, eval = FALSE}
## can't run this in rmarkdown as snapshot doesn't work
library(textures)


suppressWarnings(quad0 <- anglr::as.mesh3d(matrix(0, 1))) ## to be fixed
quad0$texcoords <- quad0$vb[1:2, ]
tfile <- tempfile()
png::writePNG(ga_topo$img/255, tfile)
quad0$material$texture <- tfile

quad0$vb[1L,] <- scales::rescale(quad0$vb[1,], to = ga_topo$extent[c("xmin", "xmax")])
quad0$vb[2L,] <- scales::rescale(quad0$vb[2L,], to = ga_topo$extent[c("ymin", "ymax")])


rgl::open3d()
rgl::par3d(windowRect = c(0, 0, 1024, 1024))
rgl::plot3d(quad0, specular = "black"); rgl::view3d(phi = 0, interactive = FALSE)
dir.create("man/figures", showWarnings = FALSE)
rgl::rgl.bringtotop()
rgl::snapshot3d("man/figures/readme_ga000.png")


```

## Re-map projections

Create a generalized surface in arbitrary map projection and remap the image losslessly ...

TODO
